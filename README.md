Overview
--------

**Vintageous** is a vi editing package for Sublime Text 3.

Vintageous is a rewrite of [Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) with the aim to make
it more similar to Vim. The new design is heavily inspired by previous work done by [dlo](https://github.com/dlo).


Download
--------

The [current build](https://bitbucket.org/guillermooo/vintageous/downloads/Vintageous.sublime-package) of Vintageous is updated frequently.


Install
-------

To install a package in Sublime Text 3, put the *.sublime-package* file inside
the *Installed Packages* folder, located under the data directory.

Vintage must be disabled (or *ignored*, in Sublime Text parlance) to avoid conflicts with Vintageous.


Development Version
-------------------

To use this development version, you should:

1. ensure the built-in Vintage package is in the ``ignored_packages`` list, as it is by default
2. zip the content of this repository and add the extension *.sublime-package* to the archive
3. copy the *.sublime-package* file to the *Installed Packages* folder, located under Sublime Text's data directory
